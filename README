This project was written in python 3.
To start the program either do:
    $ python3 main.py 
    or
    $ python3 whole.py 

main.py is contains the main function of the program. 
The classfiles used by main.py are 
 - map.py
 - player.py 
 - qlearn.py 
Additionally globalV.py conains global variables used by all classes.

whole.py is the same program but written in a single file.

Upon execution of the program a window opens, which displays the game environment (canvas).
Information about the game is written into the console.

You will be asked if you want to observe the AI while exploring.
If your answer is no ('n') you can close the canvas as it won't be used.
If your answer is yes ('y') you can observe the AI. Note that ths might take a while until finished.

After the game is finishe you will be asked if you want to view the learning curve.
If your answer is no ('n') the program will end.
If your answer is yes ('y') a pyplot will open. To terminate the program you'll have to close the pyplot and the canvas.
